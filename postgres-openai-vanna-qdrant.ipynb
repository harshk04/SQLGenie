Each entry includes a unique applicant ID, the ID of the position applied for, and the date of application submission. It tracks the application’s current stage, which could range from \"Application\" and \"Profile review\" to \"Test task\", \"Prescreen call\", \"Full Day\", \"RPI\", or \"Offer\". The status field indicates whether the application at its current stage was \"lost\", \"won\", or remains \"open\". The dataset also records the name of the recruiter managing the application, the country of the applicant, the applicant's name, and their salary expectations.This rich dataset allows for comprehensive analysis of recruiter performance, application outcomes at different stages, and salary expectations across various countries and positions. By examining this data, one can uncover insights such as the number of applications handled by each recruiter, the success rate of applications at different stages, and average salary expectations for different roles and locations. Additionally, the dataset can help identify trends and patterns in the hiring process, such as common factors contributing to successful job offers or reasons for application rejections, enabling better decision-making and strategy development in recruitment processes.\"\"\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":248,"id":"6ff3dc2d","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["'What is the distribution of job applicants across different stages of the application process?'"]},"execution_count":248,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["vn.generate_question(sql=\"SELECT stage, COUNT(*) AS number_of_applications FROM applicants GROUP BY stage;\")\n","# 'What is the name of the student?'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":249,"id":"de8654ec","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Question generated with sql: What is the distribution of applications across different stages of the process?
